      <p>A few weeks ago I visited Florida for the first time! While it was 90+ and humid everyday, it was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. My airbnb was in pompano beach, and it just so happened to be my favorite place we visited. This website is going to showcase my favorite spots in Pompano beach, some of the photos are mine and some are not. I will credit the photographers the best I can!</p>
