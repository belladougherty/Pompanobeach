      <h2>The Beach House</h2>
      <p> Beach House Pompano is one of my favorite spots right on the beach with a beautiful rooftop and ocean view. I ordered the By The Caesar salad, which came with wood-fire grilled romaine, rustic croutons, Parmesan, and a delicious house-made dressing. I added salmon, and it was perfectly grilled and full of flavor. The sun-dried tomato oil on top gave it a unique, savory touch that really stood out. The whole experience felt relaxing and upscale at the same time—perfect for a beach day dinner. </p>

      <h2>Oceanic</h2>
      <p>Oceanic at Pompano Beach offers a sleek, beachfront dining experience with a menu that emphasizes fresh seafood, creative starters, and thoughtfully executed grilled and land-based dishes. Appetizers include Calamari with smoked tomato aioli, Conch Chowder, Peruvian ceviche, and a local artisan bread basket to kick things off. From the garden, dishes like Cashew Crunch Chicken, Little Gem Caesar, and a Baby Iceberg Wedge salad bring fresh flavors and interesting textures. The seafood offerings shine with Cashew-Crusted Salmon, Seared Diver Scallops, and Seafood Pasta featuring the catch of the day. And if you prefer meat, menu highlights include Filet Mignon, New York Strip, Braised Beef Short Rib, or Churrasco Steak—plus a crisp Bacon Blue Burger for something more casual.</p>
