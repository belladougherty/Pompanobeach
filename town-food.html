      <h2>Lucky Fish</h2>
      <p>Lucky Fish Beach Bar & Grill in Dania Beach is a lively, open-air beachfront spot with laid-back tropical vibes and ocean views. They offer a casual menu with coastal favorites, burgers, tacos, and fun desserts like the Fried Oreos with Vanilla Sauce, which you enjoyed. The tiki-style bar serves up refreshing cocktails and has a popular Happy Hour on weekdays. Live music plays every weeknight from 6 to 9 p.m., creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere. It’s the perfect place to kick back, enjoy the breeze, and catch some good tunes by the water.</p>

      <h2>The Beach House</h2>
      <p> Beach House Pompano is one of my favorite spots right on the beach with a beautiful rooftop and ocean view. I ordered the By The Caesar salad, which came with wood-fire grilled romaine, rustic croutons, Parmesan, and a delicious house-made dressing. I added salmon, and it was perfectly grilled and full of flavor. The sun-dried tomato oil on top gave it a unique, savory touch that really stood out. The whole experience felt relaxing and upscale at the same time—perfect for a beach day dinner. </p>
